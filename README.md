## Eigen

Our team, Entropy Labs has developed a concept called EIGEN, which is a platform that hosts DAOs focusing on training AI models. Our team was inspired by the concept of DATA DAOs and wanted to explore how Web3 could improve data availability and decentralization compared to Web2 platforms like Kaggle and User testing.

In your brainstorming sessions, we identified various use cases but chose to go ahead with data for training AI models due to the AI willingness of users to share certain data.

The main idea of EIGEN is incentivizing data contribution by volunteers, who would be rewarded and potentially receive a royalty split when their data is used to train AI models. The platform involves four main actors: DAO Owners, Storage Providers, Volunteers/DAO Members, and End-users (those who will run the AI models).

We envision EIGEN as a collaborative platform where people can create various AI models together.
